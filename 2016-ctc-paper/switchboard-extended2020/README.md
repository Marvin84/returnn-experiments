The configs `dropout*.{5l,6l}.*.config` correspond to the CE-trained baselines.
The configs `ctcfbw.*.config` correspond to the FS-trained models.
The WERs are generated via RASR,
and the losses are calculated via the script `calc_full_sum_scores.py`.

The results are published as part of the PhD thesis of Albert Zeyer.
