These configs are based on the `base2.conv2l.specaug.curric3.config` which can be found [here](https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn-experiments/blob/master/2019-asr-e2e-trafo-vs-lstm/librispeech/base2.conv2l.specaug.curric3.config) and were extended to use external LMs.

Variables starting with `ext_` are designed to be set by the external hyper parameter tuning engine. Some useful tuning hints can be found in the paper.
