We show that a segmental model is equivalent to a transducer model.

Main config for the label-sync decoding of the end-to-end BPE transducer model is [here](https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn-experiments/blob/master/2021-transducer-thesis-merboldt/switchboard/labelsync-rna-segmental.keep_beams.config).
The transducer base config is [this one](https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn-experiments/blob/master/2021-transducer-thesis-merboldt/switchboard/rna-baseline.config),
and further configs for this transducer model can be found [here](https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn-experiments/tree/master/2020-rnn-transducer).
